	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p> I am from Sterling Heights, Michigan. I now live in Detroit and am looking to move to the Royal Oak area once my lease is up.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
	I just got back from a trip up north. We spent two days in the Mackinaw city area,two days near the Sleeping Bear Dunes, and a day in St. Joseph visiting a friend. We went to Mackinac Island and rode bikes around the island and got lunch at the Great Turtle Brewery.
